# Wifi based Water pump automation
Turn your ordinary water pump into a smart, Wi-Fi powered system! Using ESP8266, an WaterProof ultrasonic sensor, and SSR-40A, this project automates tank filling, prevents overflow, saves water, and lets you monitor and control everything in real time via Home Assistant.
